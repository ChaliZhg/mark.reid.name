title: My MLSS 2009 Lectures
excerpt: The lectures I gave at MLSS 2009 in Canberra are now up at videolectures.net.

---

In late January I gave a lecture at the [2009 Machine Learning Summer School][mlss2009] in Canberra. A [recording][] of all three hours(!) of it is now available online thanks to [videolectures.net][vl].

The material in the lecture was taken from the recent work Bob and I have been doing on [information, divergence and risk][idr]. As the summer school is aimed at new PhD students

Video at videolectures.net.

Overall I think they went well. I probably aimed the level of the material a 
little too high. I could have spent more time explaining what a Bayes risk was 
and why it is so important. Some of the later material was rushed over.

Slides are [available](http://cecs.anu.edu.au/~mreid/files/slides/MLSS2009Refs.pdf)
