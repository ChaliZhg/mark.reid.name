title: Embedding Metric Spaces in Hilbert Spaces

excerpt: When can you isometrically embed a metric space in a Hilbert space? A 
nice result in a recent JMLR paper gives a complete characterisation.

---

Paper by Hein and Sch√∂lkopf dug up a 1930's result by Schoenburg that completely
characterises when one can map points from a metric space into a Hilbert space 
and preserve the distances between all of them.

The result states that you can do this when -d^2 is conditionally positive 
semi-definite.
