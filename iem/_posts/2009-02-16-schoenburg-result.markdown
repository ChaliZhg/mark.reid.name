title: Embedding Metric Spaces in Hilbert Spaces

excerpt: When can you isometrically embed a metric space in a Hilbert space? A nice result in a recent JMLR paper gives a complete characterisation.

Paper[^1] by Hein, Bousquet and Schölkopf dug up a 1930's result by Schoenburg 
that 
completely characterises when one can map points from a metric space into a 
Hilbert space and preserve the distances between all of them.

The result states that you can do this when -d^2 is conditionally positive 
semi-definite.

> A metric $d$ defined on a space $\mathcal{X}$ is called a _Hilbertian metric_
> if $(\mathcal{X}, d)$ can be isometrically embedded into a Hilbert space,
> or equivalently if $-d^2$ is conditionally positive definite.
