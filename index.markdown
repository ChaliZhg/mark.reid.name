This is the personal website of Mark Reid. I'm currently in the process of 
transferring over my old site to this new format so not all links may work 
at present.
{: .emphfirst :}

Apologies. I expect to have the site fixed up by mid-February, 2009.

Very briefly, I'm a happily married 30-something with a Ph.D. in machine 
learning who has recently become a dad.
