About Me
========

I was born and bred in Darwin, at the “top-end” of Australia, where I finished 
high-school before moving to Sydney to complete an honours degree in pure 
mathematics and computer science at the University of New South Wales in 1996.

After graduating I continued on at UNSW, completing a PhD in machine learning at 
the School of Computer Science and Engineering in 2006. My research resulted in 
a new technique for inductive transfer for relational rule learning. During my 
candidature I moved to New York to work as an intern at IBM’s T. J. Watson 
Research Center in 2001 on an application of transfer learning in a text-mining 
domain.

Upon returning to Sydney, I worked to complete my PhD while working in a series 
of part-time and full-time jobs. From 2001 to 2003 I was a part-time programmer 
for Proxima Technology (which was acquired by Compuware in 2007) followed by a 9 
month stint as a researcher/programmer with the Smart Internet Technology CRC. 
In 2005 I started full-time work at Canon Information Systems Research Australia 
(CISRA) as a research engineer where I worked with some great people applying 
machine learning techniques to a variety of commercial problems.

I (finally) completed my PhD in 2006, after which I took up my current position 
as a post-doc in 2007 as part of the Statistical Machine Learning group at the 
Australian National University in Canberra.
