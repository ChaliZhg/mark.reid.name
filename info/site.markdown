Colophon
========

_Simplicity_ was my goal when I first decided to build this site for myself. 

I wanted the design to be stripped back but elegant to emphasise the text
and avoid the usual clutter of sidebars and other paraphernalia found on most 
blogs.

I also wanted it to be very easy to host, maintain and update. 
 

The Design
----------

When designing this site I knew I wanted to emulate the many beautifully 
constructed, minimalist web sites I'd encountered over the years. 
In the front of my mind were those by: 
[Jon Tan][jt], [Dean Allen][textism], [Dario Taraborelli][dt], 
[Ryan Tomatko][rt], and [Alex Payne][al3x].

As text is the focus, I had to learn a few things about good typography.
Two resources that helped immensely were
[The Elements of Typographic Style Applied to the Web][ets]
and Mark Boulton's [Five Simple Steps to better typography][fss].
I recommend these to anyone who wants to present stylish, readable web pages.

The main text of this site is set in Palatino with headings in Lucida
Grande.[^1] For those interested in some of the other design tricks used here
you can have a look at the [stylesheet][].

[^1]: This should be the case on Macs. These fonts may not be standard on 
earlier Windows or Linux machines, in which case Georgia or Times New
Roman and the default sans serif fonts are substituted.
