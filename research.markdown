I'm a post-doctoral Research Fellow in the 
[Research School of Information Sciences and Engineering][rsise] 
at the [Australian National University][anu] in Canberra, Australia. 
I work with other members of the [Statistical Machine Learning][sml] 
group in the [Computer Sciences Lab][csl].

My current research is into representations of machine
learning problems. I have published papers on topics
such as transfer learning, inductive logic programming (ILP), text mining, and
feature extraction.

I enjoy programming, both for research and as a hobby, and have made some of
my code available. More about me and my interests can be found
in the personal section of this site.
