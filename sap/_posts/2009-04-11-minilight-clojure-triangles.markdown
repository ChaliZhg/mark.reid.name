title: "Minilight in Clojure: Triangles"

excerpt: This is the second part of my attempt to port the Minilight ray-tracer to Clojure. This time it is triangles. Some bugs are found and fixed in the vector package.

Previously on "Porting Minilight to Clojure", our intrepid programmer (a.k.a, yours truly) braved lists, cross products and testing suites to bring you a namespace full of [vector][] operations. In this, the nail-biting sequel, I use these to build up some simple geometry in the form of triangles.

Once again, the code is on GitHub, this time tagged with [sap-2][tag] so it is easy to follow and sing along.

House-keeping...
----------------
Thanks to some [feedback][] from the Clojure mailing list, I've made a couple of small changes to the way I've set up this project: 

* I now use of fully qualified names. That is, instead of a package called `vec`, I will use the longer, Java-style `mreid.minilight.vec` to avoid potential name collisions.

* The code now lives under a `src` directory in folders corresponding to their fully-qualified package name. This meant adding a `.clojure` file with the text `src` in it so that my `clj` script can find the code.

* The tests now define a class and are executed via a main method. This is so that IDE users won't have the tests run every time the `test.clj` file is compiled.

Tests are now run from a simple shell script `runtests.sh` which has the following contents:

{% highlight sh %}
#!/bin/bash
JARS=$HOME/Library/Clojure/lib
CP=.:./src:$JARS/clojure.jar:$JARS/clojure-contrib.jar
TEST="src/mreid/minilight/test/all.clj"
MAIN="(mreid.minilight.test.all/-main)"

java -cp $CP clojure.main -i $TEST -e "$MAIN"{% endhighlight %}

...and a Bug-Fix
----------------
In the process of writing some new code I found a bug in my cross product implementation. After a bit of head-scratching, I realised that the form I use to extract a particular component from a vector assumes that the underlying data structure is a Clojure vector. I was using this `(v 0)` to get at the x-coordinate of the vector `v` which works fine for `([1 2 3] 1)` but fails spectacularly when the vector is computed as a lazy sequence. For example:

	Clojure
	user=> ((map - [1 2 3] [1 1 1]) 1)
	java.lang.ClassCastException: clojure.lang.LazySeq cannot be cast to
	clojure.lang.IFn (NO_SOURCE_FILE:0)

I used `map` in several places to compute addition, subtraction and scaling of vectors so when these were passed into `cross` they blew up.

I've added some new tests to `test/vec.clj` that test for this situation explicitly:

{% highlight clojure %}
(def dyn100 (sub [1 2 3] [0 2 3]))
(def dyn010 (sub [1 2 3] [1 1 3]))

(deftest test-dynamic-add
  (is (= [1 1 0]  (add dyn100 dyn010))))

(deftest test-dynamic-sub
  (is (= [1 -1 0] (sub dyn100 dyn010))))

(deftest test-dynamic-scale
  (is (= [2 0 0]    (scale 2 dyn100))))

(deftest test-dynamic-cross
  (is (= [0 0 1]   (cross dyn100 dyn010))))
{% endhighlight %}

and changed the definition of `cross` to use the sequence friendly `nth` instead:

{% highlight clojure %}
(defn cross 
    "Returns the cross product vector for the 3D vectors v1 and v2."
    [v1 v2] 
    [ (- (* (nth v1 1) (nth v2 2)) (* (nth v1 2) (nth v2 1)))
      (- (* (nth v1 2) (nth v2 0)) (* (nth v1 0) (nth v2 2)))
      (- (* (nth v1 0) (nth v2 1)) (* (nth v1 1) (nth v2 0))) ])
{% endhighlight %}

I guess this is one of those instances where static typing would have helped me realise my mistake earlier.

Triangles
---------
Triangles are the simplest possible polygon. They are defined by three vectors, one for each vertex. As we will be using triangles to model surfaces in a ray-tracer, I will also need two other vectors to define how light is reflected and emitted from a surface. In Clojure, this is neatly captured using a `struct`:

{% highlight clojure %}
;; --- mreid/minilight/triangle.clj ---
;; A structure and functions for defining and querying triangles.
(ns mreid.minilight.triangle
  (:use mreid.minilight.vec))
 
(defstruct triangle
  :vertices ; Collection of 3 vectors
  :reflect  ; Vector with all values in [0,1)
  :emit     ; Vector with positive values
)
{% endhighlight %}

To interrogate the structure and calculate related quantities I will also need a number of simple functions:

{% highlight clojure %}
(defn vertex
  "Returns (the zero-indexed) vertex i in the triangle t"
  [t i] (nth (:vertices t) i))

(defn edge
  "Returns the edge in the triangle t from vertex i to vertex j"
  [t i j] (sub (vertex t j) (vertex t i)))

(defn tangent
  "Returns a unit vector tangent to the given triangle t"
  [t] (normalise (edge t 0 1)))

(defn normal
  "Returns a vector normal to the given triangle t (edge01 x edge12)"
  [t] (cross (edge t 0 1) (edge t 1 2)))

(defn unit-normal
  "Returns a unit vector normal to the given triangle t"
  [t] (normalise (normal t)))

(defn area
  "Returns the are of the given triangle t"
  [t] (/ (norm (normal t)) 2))
{% endhighlight %}

This is all very straight-forward and, once again, Clojure just "gets out of the way" and make it very easy to express each of these simple functions on a single line and with a minimum of fuss. Unit tests for these can be found in the file `test/triangle.clj`.

There are three main functions left to port: one that computes a bounding-box for a triangle, one that tests whether a vector intersects a triangle, and one that randomly samples a point from a given triangle.

Bounding Boxes
--------------
The following function creates the smallest box containing all the points belonging to a triangle and then slightly expands it. It is pretty straight-forward, the only slightly tricky part is the higher-order function `tweak`. This takes in either a `+` or a `-` and will return a function that expands or shrinks _its_ input by the specified `TOLERANCE`. This is used by `bounding-box` to pull the point of a triangle closest to the origin about 0.1% closer and push the furthest point away by 0.1%.

The reason for this function is that without it I would have have two copies of the code inside the function returned by `tweak` with only a sign change. I figured this was a more [DRY][] was of writing it.

[dry]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself

{% highlight clojure %}
(def TOLERANCE (/ 1.0 1024.0))
(defn tweak
  "Returns a function that adds or subtracts a small amount"
  [add-or-sub]
  (fn [x] (add-or-sub x (* (+ (Math/abs x) 1.0) TOLERANCE))))

(defn bounding-box
  "Computes the bounding box for a triangle t, returning the result as
  a list of two vectors [lower-corner upper-corner]." 
  [t]
  (let [vs (:vertices t)]
    [ (map (tweak -) (apply map min vs))
      (map (tweak +) (apply map max vs)) ]))
{% endhighlight %}

The above code is definitely not the most efficient way of computing and expanding a bounding-box. Indeed, the Ruby code that I'm cribbing this from explicitly optimises this using a single loop through each of a triangle's vectors. In the interests of simplicity, I've opted for more two sweeps through each vector---once for the `min`/`max` and once for the `tweak`.

One discovery I made while attempting to write this was the `apply` method. Its (very terse) documentation says

	clojure.core/apply
	([f args* argseq])
	  Applies fn f to the argument list formed by prepending args to argseq.

In English, what it really does is treat a sequence of items as though they were passed in as arguments to the given function. In my case, I wanted to compute the point-wise minimum of three vectors. If these were, say, `[1 2 3]`, `[0 5 5]` and `[1 1 1]` I would simply `map` `min` onto them as arguments:

	Clojure
	user=> (map min [1 2 3] [0 5 5] [1 1 1])
	(0 1 1)

This works because `min` can take an arbitrary number of arguments (_e.g._, `min 1 0 1` gives 0) and `map`, when given several sequences, will pull items from each in parallel and pass them to the function it is mapping.

However, the problem I faced here was that the three vectors were inside a sequence and so naÃ¯vely trying the following gives the wrong result:

	user=> (map min [ [1 2 3] [0 5 5] [1 1 1] ])
	([1 2 3] [0 5 5] [1 1 1])
	
This is where `apply` comes in. It strips away the container and presents its contents to the function being applied as arguments, along with any extra arguments before the sequence:

	user=> (apply map min [ [1 2 3] [0 5 5] [1 1 1] ])
	(0 1 1)

Intersection
------------
Much of the main loop of a ray-tracing algorithm involves 

{% highlight clojure %}
(defn intersect
  "Finds the intersection with the triangle t of the ray starting at r0 in 
  direction rd. The returned value is a positive number a such that r0 + a.rd 
  is contained within t, or nil if there is no such a."
  [t r0 rd]
  (let [ e01    (edge t 0 1)
         e20    (edge t 2 0)
         invdet (invdet e01 rd e20) ]
    (if (number? invdet)
      (let [ v0 (vertex t 0)
             tv (sub r0 v0)
             u  (* (dot v0 tv) invdet) ]
        (if (and (>= u 0) (<= u 1))
          (let [ q (cross tv e01)
                 v (* (dot rd q) invdet) ]
            (if (and (>= v 0) (<= (+ u v) 1))
              (let [a (* (dot e20 q) invdet)]
                (if (>= a 0) a)))))))))
{% endhighlight %}

I'm least happy with the style of this code. The repeatedly nested `let`/`if` blocks seem ugly but I cannot see a more elegant way to do this sort of thing. 

Suggestions on how to improve this function are very welcome.

Sampling
--------

{% highlight clojure %}
(def rnd (java.util.Random.))
(defn sample-point
  "Returns a random point as a vector from inside the given triangle t"
  [t]
  (let [ sqr1 (Math/sqrt (.nextFloat rnd))
         r2   (.nextFloat rnd)
         a    (- 1 sqr1)
         b    (* (- 1 r2) sqr1) ]
    (add (vertex t 0)
        (add (scale a (edge t 0 1)) 
             (scale b (edge t 2 0))))))
{% endhighlight %}
