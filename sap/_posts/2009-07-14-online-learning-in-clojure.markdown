[Online Learning][] is a relatively old branch of machine learning that has recently regained favour for two reasons. Firstly, online learning algorithms such as [Stochastic Gradient Descent][sgd] work extremely well on very large data sets which have become increasingly prevalent (and increasingly large!). Secondly, there has been a lot of [important theoretical steps][plg] made recently in understand the convergence behaviour of these algorithms and their [relationship][] to traditional Empirical Risk Minimisation (ERM) algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs).

[plg]: http://homes.dsi.unimi.it/~cesabian/predbook/
[relationship]: http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.5328

One very nice property of these algorithms is that they are extremely simple. Here's what a general supervised online learning algorithm looks like. Given a loss function $L$ and a stream of examples $S$ of the form $(x,y)$, do the following:

	Initialise a starting model w
	While there are more examples in S
	    Get the next feature vector x
	    Predict the label y' for x using the model w
	    Get the true label y for x and incur a penaly L(y,y')
	    Update the model w if y â‰  y'

Models are usually represented as vectors of weights for the features used to represent the examples. For binary classification problems predictions involve looking at the sign of the innner product $\langle w,x \rangle$ and the update step in line 2.3 modifies the current model by moving $w$ in the direction that most reduces the loss of the incorrect prediction: that is, in the direction given by the negative [gradient][] of the loss.

Pegasos
-------
One recent online algorithm (and the one I've chosen to implement) is _[Pegasos: Primal Estimated sub-GrAdient SOlver for SVM][pegasosabs]_ ([PDF][pegasospdf]) introduced by [Shai Shalev-Shwartz][shai], [Yoram Singer][yoram] and [Nathan Srebro][nati] at [ICML 2007][icml2007] [^1]. As this is my programming blog (not my [research blog][iem]) I'll just give enough of the detail of Pegasos so you can follow the implementation.

[iem]: /iem/

Pegasos solves the same optimisation problem as [support vector machines][svm]. That is, it minimises the empirical hinge loss with $\ell_2$ regularisation:
\[ \displaystyle
	L(w,S) 
	= \frac{\lambda}{2}\|w\|^2 + \frac{1}{m} \sum_{(x,y)\in S} h(w; (x,y))
\] 
where $S$ is a set of training examples, $\|\cdot \|$ the $\ell_2$ norm, $\lambda$ the regularisation constant and 
$h(w;(x,y)) = \max\{0, 1-y\langle w, x \rangle\}$ 
is the hinge loss.

[svm]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine

The neat observation that allows optimisation problems like this to be cast as online learning problems is that the above loss can be computed using example-by-example updates rather than as a large sum. With a little care about how these updates are made fast convergence guarantees can be established.

In the case of Pegasos, if $w_t$ is the model after having seen $t$ examples and $(x,y)$ is an incorrectly predicted example, the (unnormalised) updated model is:
\[ \displaystyle
	w_{t+1} = (1-t^{-1})w_t + \frac{1}{\lambda t} yx.
\]
If the new model is outside a ball of radius $1/\sqrt{\lambda}$ it is projected back onto this ball.

Implementing it in Clojure
--------------------------
Once I understood what it was doing, Pegasos struck me as a very simple algorithm so I was itching to implement it. I was also curious as to [Clojure][]'s performance on number-crunching tasks like this, especially when the [canonical data set][rcv1] for online learning has over 700,000 examples and over 45,000 features.

[clojure]: http://clojure.org
[rcv1]: http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume5/lewis04a/lyrl2004_rcv1v2_README.htm

Represented as 45k entry feature vectors, the examples and models would quickly become unwieldy so the first order of business was to implement some sparse vector operations. Here I chose to represent vectors as hash maps where non-zero elements of a vector are stored with their index as a key and the value of the entry as value.

{% highlight clojure %}
(defn add
	"Returns the sparse sum of two sparse vectors x y"
	[x y] (merge-with + x y))

(defn inner
	"Computes the inner product of the sparse vectors (hashes) x and y"
	[x y] (reduce + (map #(* (get x % 0) (get y % 0)) (keys y))))

(defn norm
	"Returns the l_2 norm of the (sparse) vector v"
	[v] (Math/sqrt (inner v v)))

(defn scale
	"Returns the scalar product of the sparse vector v by the scalar a"
	[a v] (zipmap (keys v) (map * (vals v) (repeat a))))

(defn project
	"Returns the projection of a parameter vector w onto the ball of radius r"
	[w r] (scale (min (/ r (norm w)) 1) w))
{% endhighlight %}

The only slightly tricky thing here is the use of `zipmap` to scale a sparse vector by mapping all the keys in the original vector to their values times a scalar multiple `a`.

The other bit of framework code I required was to parse the training data. The format is a simple version of that used by [SVMlight][]. Each line of the text file containing the training data is of the form:

	y k_1:v_1 k_2:v_2 ... k_n:v_n

where `y` is the label (either `1` or `-1`), each `k_i` is an integer key representing a feature index, and each `v_i` is a floating point value.

[svmlight]: http://svmlight.joachims.org/

The Clojure code to parse this format is a pretty straight-forward application of regular expressions:

{% highlight clojure %}
(defn parse-feature 
	[string] 
	(let [ [_ key val] (re-matches #"(\d+):(.*)" string)]
		[(Integer/parseInt key) (Float/parseFloat val)]))

(defn parse-features
	[string]
	(into {} (map parse-feature (re-seq #"[^\s]+" string))))

(defn parse
	"Returns a map {:y label, :x sparse-feature-vector} parsed from given line"
	[line]
	(let [ [_ label features] (re-matches #"^(-?\d+)(.*)$" line) ]
		{:y (Float/parseFloat label), :x (parse-features features)}))
{% endhighlight %}

The main parsing function `parse` takes a whole line in this format as input and returns a hash map with key `:y` giving the label of the example and `:x` giving a hash map representing the feature vector.

Finally, the code to perform a single update step for a model given an example is built using some helper functions. The loss is computed by `hinge-loss`, the function `correct` performs a single gradient descent step, and `report` is just for diagnostics and prints some simple statistics about the model and its performance.

{% highlight clojure %}
(defn hinge-loss
	"Returns the hinge loss of the weight vector w on the given example"
	[w example] (max 0 (- 1 (* (:y example) (inner w (:x example))))))
	
(defn correct
	"Returns a corrected version of the weight vector w"
	[w example t lambda]
	(let [x   (:x example)
		  y   (:y example)
		  w1  (scale (- 1 (/ 1 t)) w)
		  eta (/ 1 (* lambda t))
		  r   (/ 1 (Math/sqrt lambda))]
		(project (add w1 (scale (* eta y) x)) r)))

(defn report
	"Prints some statistics about the given model at the specified interval"
	[model interval]
	(if (zero? (mod (:step model) interval))
		(let [t      (:step model)
		      size   (count (keys (:w model)))
		      errors (:errors model) ]
			(println "Updates:" t 
				 "\t Feature count for w =" size 
				 "\t Total errors =" errors 
				 "\t Running accuracy =" (/ (float errors) t)))))

(defn update
	"Returns an updated model by taking the last model, the next training 
	 and applying the Pegasos update step"
	[model example]
	(let [lambda (:lambda model)
		  t      (:step   model)
		  w      (:w      model)
		  errors (:errors model)
		  error  (> (hinge-loss w example) 0)]
		(do 
			(report model 100)
			{ :w      (if error (correct w example t lambda) w), 
			  :lambda lambda, 
			  :step   (inc t), 
			  :errors (if error (inc errors) errors)} )))
{% endhighlight %}

As you can see, this function returns a new, updated model as a hash that contains the feature weights `:w` as well as several other useful bits of information including the culmulative number of errors (in `:errors`) and the total number of update steps (in `:steps`). The parameter $\lambda$ which controls the amount of regularisation is also passed along in the model (in `:lambda`) for convenience.

(_A brief aside_: If I have one criticism of Clojure as a language it's that implementing numerical procedures is a real pain. Prefix notation (while neatly side-stepping problems of operator precedence) is just a lot harder to read than the infix notation that many non-Lisp languages use.)

Now the update step is implemented, training a model online from a sequence of examples is a simple application of `reduce`. The following code repeated calls `(update model example)` where each example is taken from the sequence `examples` and the model output by the last call to `update` is used as input for the next.

{% highlight clojure %}
(defn train
	"Returns a model trained from the initial model on the given examples"
	[initial examples]
	(reduce update initial examples))
{% endhighlight %}

All that's needed now is a main method to read examples from the standard input, parse them into vectors and train a model from some starting point:

{% highlight clojure %}
(defn main
	"Call to run the example"
	[] (let [start 	{:lambda 0.0001, :step 1, :w {}, :errors 0} 
		     examples 	(map parse (-> *in* BufferedReader. line-seq)) ]
		(report (train start examples) 1)))
{% endhighlight %}

The full version of the code is [available at GitHub][github].

Running It
----------
To see whether the algorithms (or at least my implementation of it) performs as advertised I ran it on the aforementioned RCV1 data set. 

This is a big data set. The gzipped version of the full data set weighs in at 423Mb. Understandably, I'm not going to host a file that size so to get the full data set it you will have to follow the [instructions at LÃ©on Bottou's SGD page][data] and make it yourself.

[data]: http://leon.bottou.org/projects/sgd

That said, I have created a 2,000 example version called `train.dat` that is checked into the [repository][github].

With the training data in hand as a file called `train.dat.gz` I run my implementation of Pegasos (in the file `sgd.clj`) like so:

	$ zless train.dat.gz | clj sgd.clj
	Updates: 100 	 Features count for w = 2145 	 Total errors = 64 	 Running accuracy = 0.64
	Updates: 200 	 Feature count for w = 3333 	 Total errors = 123 	 Running accuracy = 0.615
	Updates: 300 	 Feature count for w = 4051 	 Total errors = 175 	 Running accuracy = 0.5833333
	Updates: 400 	 Feature count for w = 4755 	 Total errors = 229 	 Running accuracy = 0.5725
	Updates: 500 	 Feature count for w = 5236 	 Total errors = 276 	 Running accuracy = 0.552
	Updates: 600 	 Feature count for w = 5576 	 Total errors = 318 	 Running accuracy = 0.53
	Updates: 700 	 Feature count for w = 5870 	 Total errors = 356 	 Running accuracy = 0.50857145
	Updates: 800 	 Feature count for w = 6050 	 Total errors = 388 	 Running accuracy = 0.485
	Updates: 900 	 Feature count for w = 6325 	 Total errors = 418 	 Running accuracy = 0.46444446
	Updates: 1000 	 Feature count for w = 6578 	 Total errors = 444 	 Running accuracy = 0.444
