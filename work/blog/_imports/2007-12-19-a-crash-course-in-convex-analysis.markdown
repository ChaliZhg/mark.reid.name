I've been attempting to read an interesting [NIPS 2007][] paper entitled [Estimating divergence functionals and the likelihood ratio by convex risk minimzation][Nguyen et al 2007] and realised my knowledge of convex analysis was sketchy at best.

Fortunately, [Wikipedia][] pointed me to an excellent [summary of the Legendre-Fenchel transformation][LF transform] by [Hugo Touchette][]. A bit more digging around Hugo's site led me to a great [cheat sheet][] for convex analysis, covering many of the concepts that were causing me trouble.

Great stuff!
