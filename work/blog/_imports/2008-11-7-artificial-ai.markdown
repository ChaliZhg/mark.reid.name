Anyone who has working in the area for long enough knows how difficult creating any type of artificial intelligence can be. Like many before me, I've decided to cheat a little and create an artificial AI. I take partial credit for the initial idea but it is my wife, Julieanne, who has been responsible for most of the development over the last nine months. 

We had our official release on the 26th of October and even though she's been here for less than two weeks she is already exceeding all our expectations. 

We refer to her as "Ada Molly Reid".
