Research
========
I'm a post-doctoral Research Fellow in the 
[Research School of Information Sciences and Engineering][rsise] 
at the [Australian National University][anu] in Canberra, Australia. 
I work with other members of the [Statistical Machine Learning][sml] 
group in the [Computer Sciences Lab][csl].

My current [research][] is into representations of — and relationships between 
— machine learning problems with [Bob Williamson][bob]. The most complete 
summary of this work so far can be found in our technical report "[Information, 
Divergence and Risk for Binary Experiments][infodiv]".

Activities
==========
As well as reviewing for journals ([JMLR][], [PAMI][] and [Trans. on Info. Theory][infotheory]) and conferences ([NIPS][], [ICML][], [COLT][], and [UAI][]), I have also set up a [discussion site][icmldisc] for ICML 2008 and 2009 and [presented][mlss2009] at the 2009 Machine Learning Summer School.
