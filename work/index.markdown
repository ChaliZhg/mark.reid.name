Research
========
I'm a post-doctoral Research Fellow in the 
[Research School of Information Sciences and Engineering][rsise] 
at the [Australian National University][anu] in Canberra, Australia. 
I work with other members of the [Statistical Machine Learning][sml] 
group in the [Computer Sciences Lab][csl]. As of July 2009, I also work part-time with [NICTA][]'s research groups.

[Publications](/work/pubs/)
============
I have [published][] papers on topics in learning theory, transfer learning, and inductive logic programming (ILP).
A summary of my recent work can be found in _[Information, Divergence and Risk for Binary Experiments](http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.0356)_.

Since September 2007 I have kept a blog on machine learning and statistical 
inference called _[inductio ex machina](/iem/)_.
